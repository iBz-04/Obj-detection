# Object Detection with TensorFlow SSD MobileNet V2

This project demonstrates object detection using TensorFlow's SSD MobileNet V2 model, a pre-trained model from the TensorFlow Object Detection API. The model is capable of detecting common objects in images with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.


## Installation

Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iBz-04/Obj-detection
cd https://github.com/iBz-04/Obj-detection
```
    
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pillow (PIL)
- Matplotlib


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/iBz-04/Obj-detection
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd https://github.com/iBz-04/Obj-detection
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install tensorflow 
  pip install numpy 
  pip install opencv
  pip install pillow
